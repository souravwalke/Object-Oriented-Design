**Design Principles**

1. Encapsulate the parts that vary so you can later alter or extend them without affecting those that donâ€™t.
   
2. *Program to an Interface, Not an Implementation*
   - This principle suggests that you should depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) instead of concrete implementations.
